      content: `Due to limited time and resources in the class, I came up with the idea of making a minimalist mobile game 
      so that we could save time on creating assets and focus more on the gameplay. After the pitch, my concept was picked 
      as one of the class projects. I teamed up with Hal, who created all the audio assets for Cube Planet. I worked on the design, programming and game mechanics. 
      We playtested this project at several events across campus and released an Alpha test on Google Play store.`
