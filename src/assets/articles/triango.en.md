#### Intro

TrianGo is a puzzle platformer game I designed using simple mechanics such as colors and shapes. It’s about a triangle, Trian, who wants to become a circle so that he can roll smoothly. In each level, the player needs to get though the destination, a portal, by transforming itself into different shapes and colors to defeat enemies and move across obstacles.

You can press A and D to move, SPACE to jump. Press A and D with S being held, you will be rolling instead of moving. There’re some interactible objects in the environment. By pressing E you can let Trian interact with them, such as turn on a switch.

#### The Ask

Design creative game mechanics and build a prototype.

#### The Answer

My inspiration was from my “5 in 5” project, for which I built 5 games in 5 days with the constraints of only using colors and shapes for the graphics. From that project, I found the unlimited possibilities of the most basic elements, which led to the concept of TrianGo.

I drew all the 2D assets on a tablet, tweaked them in Photoshop, and created a video prototype with After Effects and Premiere as a proof of concept. The implementation was done with Unity and C#. While there were only 2 weeks for it, I managed to build 2 levels by the end of the semester.
