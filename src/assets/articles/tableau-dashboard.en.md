#### Background

For a long time, the company's management has relied on the Excel reports reported by various business departments to understand the company's various indicators, and lacks a flexible, visualized and real-time update data board. I proposed to my boss to introduce Tableau, starting from the index market, and gradually improving the management's BI self-service query capabilities, which can also provide a foundation for the establishment of a data analysis team in the future.

#### Task

This project is considered as an internal side project, which is not in the scope of my responsibility. But thanks to the academic background related to data visualization and the interest in this project, I got this opportunity to explore my boundaries. After confirming the requirements of the dashboard with my boss, I completed the project together with Korey, a back-end engineer. Korey is responsible for organizing data sources and basic SQL statements. I configure Tableau to integrate various data sources, improve SQL according to requirements, design and produce dashboards, and be responsible for the final results.
