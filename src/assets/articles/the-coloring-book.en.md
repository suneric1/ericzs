#### Intro

The Coloring Book is a website where you can pick blank illustration templates and color them in, just like the Secret Garden coloring book. When coloring you are presented with a color palette with 12 colors but, to help you get creative, there is a Blend Mode that allows you to mix the colors. I also made it mobile friendly with a responsive design.

The app also allows you to view all the paintings by previous users merged together so you can see trends and use of color.

#### The Ask

Create a web application using Node.js with database manipulation for a midterm class project.

#### The Answer

The class was mainly about using databases and learning how to use Node.js, however, I didn’t want to create a boring form that collects and stores data. For me, the project should not only meet the professor’s requirements, but also be able to collect interesting data without being explicit about it. Also, since this is a web app designed for relaxing, mobile should be a major target platform, so I made it responsive.
