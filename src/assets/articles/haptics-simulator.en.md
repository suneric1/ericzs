#### Intro

Haptics Simulator is an experimental physical computing project. I used an Arduino, a modified speaker and some sensors to simulate some haptics feedback.

There are 3 modes - Rough Surface, Force Touch, and Rolling Ball.

###### Rough Surface

This basically simulates the sense of scratching on a rough surface, while the actual surface is smooth.

###### Force Touch

Force Touch is just like the force touch on a MacBook. When you press the surface, it plays the vibration and make it feel like a button.

###### Rolling Ball

This mode is simulating a ball rolling inside of the box. When you tilt the box, you can hear the sound of a metal ball rolling then hitting the wall.
