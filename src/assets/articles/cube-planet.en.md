#### Intro

Cube Planet is a puzzle game with a minimalist design.

In certain levels, there are rocks that might get in your way. They can block your path, or in some cases, be placed strategically to help you. Some rocks also slide when you hit them. The end result is a fun to play puzzle game thatâ€™s highly addictive.

#### The Ask

As I was taking a Project Management class and Game Development class at the same time, I decided to work on a game project for both classes.

#### The Answer

Due to limited time and resources in the class, I came up with the idea of making a minimalist mobile game so that we could save time on creating assets and focus more on the gameplay. I teamed up with Hal, who created all the audio assets for Cube Planet. I worked on the design, programming and game mechanics. We playtested this project at several events across campus and released an Alpha test on Google Play store.
